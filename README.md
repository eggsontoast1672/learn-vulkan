# Learn Vulkan

My adventures learning the Vulkan API. I am following along with the [Vulkan Tutorial][1]
website. The tutorial is a bit dated, but I would like to learn the very basics
of the API before jumping into more modern features. Additionally, the official
Khronos documentation on Vulkan uses the C++ API, which I would also like to
learn a bit later on. I am using C++ for this project alongside Vulkan's C API.

Since this is a learning project, I am trying to make the code as straight
forward and verbose as possible. There are lots of comments in the source
explaining how all of the components work.
